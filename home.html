					Hello, my name is Eli Orona and this is my
					<del>bad</del>
					website. I'm not too sure what I should put here but it's a bio. I
					also dont want to go too deep because I'm pretty sure that no one
					wants to know when I was born or my first word. Ok, to start I
					currently attend <a href="https://bsd405.org/sammamish/">Sammamish
						High School</a> in the <a href="https://bsd405.org/">Bellevue
						School District</a>. I am in the ninth grade. I participate in band,
					which includes marching band and concert band, playing the clarinet
					and bassoon. I am also part of the robotics team, <a href="https://www.robototes.com/">Robototes 2412</a>, as a
					programmer. In my free time I like to play video games like
					Minecraft and Overwatch, <a href="music.html">write music</a>, and
					<a href="code.html">code</a> some cool things.

					<p class="indent">I have spent a lot of time in my life on
						playing, writing, and listening to music. I played piano in the
						first grade and then from 3rd grade to 6th grade. I also started
						band, playing the clarinet, in 5th grade and continue to play
						until this day, adding the bassoon in 9th grade. I write my own
						music in FL Studio Moblie, mostly writing EDM. I try to write
						melodic dubstep, future bass, and house. I also listen to lots of
						music, often losing track of songs that I love. I mostly listen to
						EDM, especially artists like Martin Garrix, Avicii, Alan Walker,
						and Tiesto. However, I like almost all music, especially movie
						soundtracks, epic orchestral, and some alt. Rock as long as it is
						not boring pop music or basic overused rap.</p>

					<p>Along with a significant part of my life dedicated to music, I also spend a lot of my free time writing code. I started back in 4th grade, 2014, with javascript on <a href="khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, and then began to learn HTML
						and CSS (Khan Academy and personal), Python (I hate this language), C++(Arduino), SQL (Khan Academy), C# (Unity), and Java (Self-taught). Khan Academy included the <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> library, which easily trasitioned me
						into Java as it has
						a very object oriented view on JavaScript. I now mostly program in Java, creating all sorts of projects. I am currently trying to find a way to upload my code to this site. Because of my start on Khan Academy, I prefer to use a graphics
						library for my Java code, and until I found LWJGL I used the Processing library for Java. I have a stong interest in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, programming three complete feed-foward networks (only one had learning),
						and I am currently working on a fourth that will include learning, easy layer adding, and multiple types of layers like LSTM and GRU.</p>
