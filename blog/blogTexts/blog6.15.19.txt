Ah, yes the end is near. One week of school left. This has been a really great school year and I have really enjoyed my freshman year and all the new friends that I made along the way. This weekend I have a few projects to finish up, and then I should have no more homework for the rest of the year. YAY! Sadly, my summer won't just be fun as I have summer school to skip health and then driver's ed, but I won't really mind those things. I also have been working on my neural network in Java, and its coming along really well, as in I have completed a simple feed-forward network with training, and I am currently trying to train it on the MNIST database, but it has an issue where it trains too generally and I'm getting very similar results for different numbers.
